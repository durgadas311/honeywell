+ SUPERV:
	implement HALT name
	implement alt search modes:
		01 = ++seg, search and load (decimal add only)
		X2 = no load, return MS adr only
		07 = load from prev MS adr
	impl card reader for EX
	imple reloc augment?
	impl special start adr

	Undoc/extensions:
		load from alt disk unit
		load from GO file (done, 'G' in loc 110)
		BRR/IBR and relocation (incompatible progs - reloc aug?)

+ Util:
	BRT map
	Executables source from BRT

+ AAAMONS1
