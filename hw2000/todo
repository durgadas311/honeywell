+ SUPERV use "execute" command format:
	Read > 6 chars, parse:
		EX____ = run from *DRS1RES
		TEST__ = run from *DRS1GO (non-Honeywell)
		????__ = run from BRT tape?
	If < 6 chars (i.e. RETURN pressed) or 7th != space, ignore (loop).
	If bad, print "WHAT?" and loop.
	If good, read next N (54) chars (or till RETURN), parse
		prog+seg (ignore halt name), load/run.
