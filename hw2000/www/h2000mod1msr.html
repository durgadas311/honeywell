<H2>MOD1 MSR Operating System Implementation</H2>

<P> An implementation/simulation of the MOD1 MSR (Mass Storage Resident)
operating system and programming environment is available. This provides
an easy way to manipulate files on mass storage media (Disk Packs).
This feature is implemented as a set of java virtual extensions.
See <A HREF="h2000extending.html">Virtual Series 2000 Extensions</A>
for more on virtual software extensions.

<P>Features of "File Support C" and "Volume Preparation C" are implemented in
the menu "Disk Util". These allow initialization of a volume, mapping (listing)
of a volume, and allocation (create) and deallocation (delete) of files.
See information in <A HREF="h2000operation.html">Basic Operation</A>.

<P>Access to files (data) in programs is through the MOD1MSIO virtual macros
package, invoked (loaded) using the "MAC" assembler directive as described in
<A HREF="h2000easycoder.html">Easycoder Assembler Implementation</A>.
Apart from the non-standard virtual extension "MAC", the macros are
used as described in the original MOD1 documentation, with the following exceptions:

<UL>
<LI>Only Sequential Organization files are supported.
<LI>Only single-volume files are supported.
<LI>LOCATE item-delivery mode is not Supported.
<LI>Password protection is not Supported.
<LI>The MUCA and MLCA macros are not supported.
<LI>Cylinder and general overflow is not Supported.
<LI>File date-stamping is not Supported.
<LI>File data type designation (print-image, etc) is not Supported.
<LI>Advisory EXITs are not supported (for example,
the EXIT to allow a program to extract *VOLDESCR* information during MSOPEN).
<LI>more...?
</UL>

<P>Here is a sample program to read a file named "MYFILE01" and print it,
simplified for clarity.

<P>At card (line) 00050 is the modern (non-standard) extension
to EasyCoder to load a macro library.
<P>At line 00070 is the initialization of MIOC, declaring instance "A".
Note that, in this implementation, all of MIOC/MPIOC is in a virtual runtime and
thus consumes no extra program memory, making most parameters to MIOC irrelevant.
<P>Beginning at line 00090 is the definition of the MCA for "MYFILE01".
<P>At line 00190 the file is opened for input-only. Note, any failures at this point
cause an EXIT call which is fatal/terminal.
<P>At line 00200 one item is read from the file. Note, a Data EXIT for EOF
will cause a graceful end to the program, checked on line 00330.
<P>In the case of a graceful end, the file is closed on line 00250.
