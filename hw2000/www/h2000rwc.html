<BODY>
This implementation does not follow the various Honeywell documentation
for specific Read/Write Channels and combinations.
There are 16 completely independent RWCs, with the SLCs (C1 character) numbered
10-17 and 30-37 (CLCs numbered 00-07 and 20-27, respectively).

<P>RWCs are implemented as independent threads. This means a PDT instruction
will actually complete before the I/O operation completes, just like
original hardware.
In addition, the I/O operation, running in the "background" thread,
no longer has a guaranteed program context. This is why the CLC and SLC
registers contain physical addresses.
In nearly all cases it is required the issue a PCB
instruction to wait for completion, although it is up to the programmer whether
that wait is done immediately after the PDT or before the next PDT on the same channel
(or in some polling fashon).

<P>The association between channel and perihperal is established when the
PDT instruction is executed, and dissolved once the channel is "not busy".

<P>Currently, peripheral insterrupts are not implemented,
except for the Interval Timer "timeout".

<P>For many peripherals, it is possible to return less input data than requested.
A program can query the CLC register to determine this, however since these registers
contain physical addresses is will normally be necessary to subtract SLC from CLC
to yield the length of transfer for comparison.

<P>In the case that a request buffer (RM in memory) was not enough to contain
the peripheral record (typically for Console, Mag Tape, and Disk), the
CLC will be pointing to one character past the RM character.
To summarize:
<UL>
<LI>When buffer and peripheral record lengths match, CLC will point to the RM character.
<LI>When the buffer is too small, CLC will point to character RM + 1.
<LI>When less data was transferred, CLC will point to the character after
the last valid character (i.e. CLC will point to a location before the RM character).
</UL>
