<H3>File</H3>
<UL>
<H4>Assemble</H4>
<UL>
Assemble a program into memory. If the monitor has been activated,
the program will be assembled into a memory region that is relocated
above the monitor, and the monitor data structures will be filled-in
to indicate how to run the job.
</UL>
<H4>Monitor</H4>
<UL>
Assemble the monitor program and setup the Assemble option to use it.
There is a monitor program supplied in the sample programs tarball,
"monitor.ezc".
When the monitor is active, this menu option will be disabled (grayed-out).
Clicking INITIALIZE (after STOP) will reset monitor mode.

<P>The assemble dialogs have a checkbox for "Listing". This causes an assembly
listing to printed on the Line Printer, along with a dump of the symbol table.
<P>The assemble dialogs also have options for creating a Magnetic Tape Image,
although the program is still assembled into main memory and then the entire
range is written to tape. This option creates a self-loading image,
which has the following record format:
<OL>
<LI>The loader, bootmt.mti
<LI>A header containing information about the program
<LI>The program image
<LI>The punctuation map for the program
</OL>
The loader will restore punctuation based on the information in the tape image.
Such a tape image may be mounted on tape drive 000 and used with the
BOOTSTRAP and RUN buttons to load and run the program. The loader,
bootmt.mti, was created from bootstrap.ezc in the sample programs.
