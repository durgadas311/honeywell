<P>The model 204 9-track tape units implement basic sequential-only storage.
<P>
The device is at the traditional address of 00/40.
This implementation relys on tape record marks to delimit records.
Two adjacent record marks indicate a file mark.
Furthermore, a RM in the memory buffer will stop a transfer.
The CLC and SLC reghisters may be used to determine whether more data existed.
<P>
A record of 0-length is a File Mark, typically meaning End Of File.
End of Tape (EOF on image file) will return 0-length records.
Full rewind as well as backspace to record/file marks is supported,
however exact placement after backspace needs to be confirmed
with details of how real hardware worked.

<P>
<P>Each drive has a mount/unmount button that is labeled for the
drive number (000 - 007). Clicking this button opens a file dialog window
for selecting the tape image to be mounted (pressing Cancel will leave no
image mounted).
In addition, a rewind button exists. Active drives will show current 
tape position in characters.
