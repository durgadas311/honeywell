</HEAD>
<BODY>
The front panel buttons should behave according to normal Honeywell
series 200/2000 operation, however the power buttons are not functional.
Buttons are not currently labeled, however
buttons that might have a less-than-obvious function should have a
"tooltip" that will appear when the mouse pointer hovers over them.
Note, as is the case for original hardware, most buttons will not function
unless the STOP indicator is on. The only exceptions are STOP and
INTERRUPT.

<P> Menus are as follows:
<UL>
<LI>File: Assemble a program or assemble the monitor.
<LI>I/O: Control visibility of I/O device windows. Device windows that are
hidden or obscured may be raised by selecting the device.
<LI>Debug: Some debug features.
</UL>

<H3>File</H3>
<UL>
<H4>Assemble</H4>
<UL>
Assemble a program into memory. If the monitor has been activated,
the program will be assembled into a memory region that is relocated
above the monitor, and the monitor data structures will be filled-in
to indicate how to run the job.
</UL>
<H4>Monitor</H4>
<UL>
Assemble the monitor program and setup the Assemble option to use it.
There is a monitor program supplied in the sample programs tarball,
"monitor.ezc".
When the monitor is active, this menu option will be disabled (grayed-out).
Clicking INITIALIZE (after STOP) will reset monitor mode.
</UL>
</UL>
<H3>Debug</H3>
<UL>
<H4>Trace</H4>
<UL>
Trace is enabled for the range of memory of the last assembled program.
</UL>
<H4>Trace Full</H4>
<UL>
A dialog is presented for specifying the range of memory to trace.
</UL>
<H4>Trace Off</H4>
<UL>
Cancel any active tracing.
</UL>
<H4>Dump</H4>
<UL>
A memory dump is printed to the Line Printer for the range of memory of the last assembled program.
</UL>
<H4>Dump Full</H4>
<UL>
A dialog is presented for specifying the range of memory to dump.
</UL>
</UL>

<P>NOTE: The "Initialize" button currently also clears all memory locations.
This helps avoid complications due to latent punctuation from previous
programs, although assembling a program will replace punctuation for all
segments that produce code
(i.e. RESV, or regions skipped by ORGs, would otherwise retain previous punctuation).

<P>The assemble dialogs have a checkbox for "Listing". This causes an assembly
listing to printed on the Line Printer, along with a dump of the symbol table.
<P>The assemble dialogs also have options for creating a Magnetic Tape Image,
although the program is still assembled into main memory and then the entire
range is written to tape. This option creates a self-loading image,
which has the following record format:
<OL>
<LI>The loader, bootmt.mti
<LI>A header containing information about the program
<LI>The program image
<LI>The punctuation map for the program
</OL>
The loader will restore punctuation based on the information in the tape image.
Such a tape image may be mounted on tape drive 000 and used with the
BOOTSTRAP and RUN buttons to load and run the program. The loader,
bootmt.mti, was created from bootstrap.ezc in the sample programs.

<H2>Display</H2>
The Contents and Address indicators will light during a program run, however
updates are limited to only the instruction op-code extraction and only every 20
instructions. Otherwise, the GUI updates would signficantly slow down the run.
When a stop occurs, either by clicking STOP or by executing Halt, the Contents
and Address are updated with the appropriate values.

<P>The Control address is actually the same address used by the variant character
for LCR/SCR. So, for example, SR is 77. All unspecified addresses have registers
behind them, but only the documented ones are used by the processor. These other
registers may be used as desired.  Also note that CLC/SLC registers may be accessed,
and should have values from most recent PDT instructions used on them.
In this implementation, CLC and SLC contain physical addresses, so for programs
running under the monitor they will have the relocated address, not the
address used by the program instructions. This means that examining memory
from the front panel using these registers will have the desired results.
