For an overview of what is supplied in "hwprogs.tgz", see
<A HREF="h2000programs.html">List of Sample Files</A>

<H2>MCETESTS</H2>
This program performs some testing of the MCE instruction.
The tests are taken from various Honeywell documentation that
gave examples.
<P>To run the test, select File->Assemble then choose "mcetests.ezc"
and click "Assemble". A pop-up window should appear with results of the
assembly. If the "Listing" option was selected, the LinePrinter window
should also have appeared, and should have the assembler listing on it.

<P>To run the test, press the RUN button. Output should appear on
the LinePrinter window for each test performed.

<P>If desired, a memory dump may be produced by selecting
Debug->Dump. The dump should appear on the LinePrinter window.

<P>A copy of the expected LinePrinter output is
<A HREF="mcetests.html">here</A>.
Note, the Honeywell "credit" symbol does not exist in modern unicode/ISO
character sets, so it will apear here as the copyright symbol.
The LinePrinter and Console use a custom font that does contain
a glyph for the credit symbol.

<H2>PUNCHED CARDS</H2>

<P>This demo will take data from a magnetic tape and punch that onto cards,
and then read those cards and print them on the line printer.

<OL>
<LI>Open/raise the MagTape window and mount the file "barberpole.mti" on
tape drive 000.
<LI>Open/raise the PunchCard window and mount a new file in the Punch Stacker.
<LI>Select menu File->Assemble and choose the file "puntest2.ezc" and click "Assemble".
<LI>Press RUN.  The card punch should show 311 cards punched. The tape drive will show about 25192,
the number of bytes used in the image for records and record marks.
<LI>Unmount the punch card deck from the Punch Stacker (click Punch Stacker, then
click Cancel).
<LI>Mount the newly-punched deck of cards in the Read Hopper.
<LI>Select menu File->Assemble and choose the file "rdrtest.ezc" and click "Assemble".
<LI>Press RUN. The card reader should show "311 END" to indicate that it read 311
cards and then ran out of cards. The line printer should show 311 lines of the barber pole pattern.
</OL>

<H2>MOD1 MASS STORAGE FILES</H2>

<P>This demo will take data from a card deck (e.g. as produced in previous example)
and write that onto a mass storage file (disk pack),
and then read back that file and print the records on the line printer.
This example goes through all steps required to initialize a new volume,
create a file, and use the file. If you already have a disk pack initialized,
or files allocated, some steps may be skipped. Note, these example programs
have the file name hard-coded, so require modification if the file name
is to change. Also, MOD1 files have strict item/record sizes and this program
expects the item size to be 80 characters.

<OL>
<LI>Open/raise the Disks window and mount a new file on disk drive 000.
<LI>Select menu Disk_Util->Initialize_Volume and
<UL>
	<LI>Enter a volume name and serial number.
	<LI>Click OK to initialize the volume.
	<LI>NOTE: The drive FMT and DAT permit switches must be ON.
</UL>
<LI>Select menu Disk_Util->Allocate_File and
<UL>
	<LI>Enter the file name "MYFILE01" (unless the programs have been altered
	for a different file name).
	<LI>Enter Item Len of "80" and Rec Len of "240".
	<LI>Enter Allocation Units. A minimum of 3 tracks are needed to hold the
	311 cards created in the previous example.
	<LI>Click OK to create the file.
	<LI>NOTE: The drive FMT and DAT permit switches must be ON.
</UL>
<LI>Optionally, use the Disk_Util->Map_Volume menu item to print
the files and allocation of the volume.
<LI>Open/raise the PunchCard window and mount a card deck, such as the
barber pole one created in the previous example.
<LI>Select menu File->Assemble and choose the file "mod1test1.ezc" and click "Assemble".
<LI>Press RUN. The card reader should show 311 cards read, and "END".
The disk drive should show current position on the third track allocated.
NOTE: The drive DAT permit switch must be ON.
<LI>Select menu File->Assemble and choose the file "mod1test2.ezc" and click "Assemble".
<LI>Press RUN. The disk drive should momentarily show activity and then
advance to final position of the previous step. The line printer 
should have printed the 311-line barber pole pattern and "FINISHED".
NOTE: No drive PERMIT switches are required.
</OL>

<H2>FORTRAN CHARACTER CONVERSION</H2>

<P>This demo will print a punch card deck containing a FORTRAN IV program
that was punched based on symbols printed by an IBM 029 keypunch,
not the Honeywell symbols.
<A HREF="h2000keypunch.html">Details</A> for those interested.
This program consults the SENSE 1 switch to
see whether or not to convert those special characters (using a MAT instruction).

<OL>
<LI>Open/raise the PunchCards window and mount the file "prog3.pcd" in
the Read Hopper.
<LI>Select menu File->Assemble and choose the file "rdrtest.ezc" and click "Assemble".
<LI>Press RUN. The short program-segment should be printed on the line printer -
although many of the special characters will appear wrong for FORTRAN program
syntax.
<LI>It will be necessary to re-mount the card deck, in order to start over for
the next step.
<LI>Select menu File->Assemble and choose the file "rdrtest.ezc" and click "Assemble".
<LI>Press the SENSE 1 switch (it should now be lighted).
<LI>Press RUN. The short program-segment should be printed again,
this time the FORTRAN special characters should appear as expected.
</OL>

<H2>BINARY RUN TAPE</H2>

<P>This demo will create a "binary run tape"
(<A HREF="h2000brt.html">BRT</A> - self-loading program image on mag tape)
and then use BOOTSTRAP to run it.

<OL>
<LI>Open/raise the MagTape window and mount a "blank tape" (new file) on tape drive 000.
<LI>Select menu File->Assemble and choose the file "mcetests.ezc",
check the "Tape Image" box, and click "Assemble".
This will create a BRT image on the new file.
<LI>Rewind the tape on tape drive 000.
<LI>For the 220-3 console, enter the bootstrap command "B 40 0000000".
For the full control panel:
<OL><LI>Enter 40 into Contents (using the clear button as needed).
<LI>Ensure Address is 0 (use the clear button as needed).
<LI>Press BOOTSTRAP.
</OL>
The tape drive should indicate that about 6 bytes were read.
This will be the BRT "1HDR&#916;" record.
<LI>Repeat the bootstrap step to load the actual bootstrap record.
Tape drive should show 361 bytes have been read.
<LI>Press RUN. The tape drive should stop at about 3197 bytes and the line printer
should show the output of running the mcetests program.
</OL>
