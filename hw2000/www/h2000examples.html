<H2>MCETESTS</H2>
This program performs some testing of the MCE instruction.
The tests are taken from various Honeywell documentation that
gave examples.
<P>To run the test, select File->Assemble then choose "mcetests.ezc"
and click "Assemble". A pop-up window should appear with results of the
assembly. If the "Listing" option was selected, the LinePrinter window
should also have appeared, and should have the assembler listing on it.

<P>To run the test, press the RUN button. Output should appear on
the LinePrinter window for each test performed.

<P>If desired, a memory dump may be produced by selecting
Debug->Dump. The dump should appear on the LinePrinter window.

<P>A copy of the expected LinePrinter output is
<A HREF="mcetests.html">here</A>.
Note, the Honeywell "credit" symbol does not exist in modern unicode/ISO
character sets, so it will apear here as the copyright symbol.
The LinePrinter and Console use a custom font that does contain
a glyph for the credit symbol.
