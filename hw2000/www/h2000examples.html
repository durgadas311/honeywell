For an overview of what is supplied in "hwprogs.tgz", see
<A HREF="h2000programs.html">List of Sample Files</A>

<H2>MCETESTS</H2>
This program performs some testing of the MCE instruction.
The tests are taken from various Honeywell documentation that
gave examples.
<P>To run the test, select File->Assemble then choose "mcetests.ezc"
and click "Assemble". A pop-up window should appear with results of the
assembly. If the "Listing" option was selected, the LinePrinter window
should also have appeared, and should have the assembler listing on it.

<P>To run the test, press the RUN button. Output should appear on
the LinePrinter window for each test performed.

<P>If desired, a memory dump may be produced by selecting
Debug->Dump. The dump should appear on the LinePrinter window.

<P>A copy of the expected LinePrinter output is
<A HREF="mcetests.html">here</A>.
Note, the Honeywell "credit" symbol does not exist in modern unicode/ISO
character sets, so it will apear here as the copyright symbol.
The LinePrinter and Console use a custom font that does contain
a glyph for the credit symbol.

<H2>PUNCHED CARDS</H2>

<P>This demo will take data from a magnetic tape and punch that onto cards,
and then read those cards and print them on the line printer.

<OL>
<LI>Open/raise the MagTape window and mount the file "barberpole.mti" on
tape drive 000.
<LI>Open/raise the PunchCard window and mount a new file in the Punch Stacker.
<LI>Select menu File->Assemble and choose the file "puntest2.ezc" and click "Assemble".
<LI>Press RUN.  The card punch should show 311 cards punched. The tape drive will show about 25192,
the number of bytes used in the image for records and record marks.
<LI>Unmount the punch card deck from the Punch Stacker (click Punch Stacker, then
click Cancel).
<LI>Mount the newly-punched deck of cards in the Read Hopper.
<LI>Select menu File->Assemble and choose the file "rdrtest.ezc" and click "Assemble".
<LI>Press RUN. The card reader should show "311 END" to indicate that it read 311
cards and then ran out of cards. The line printer should show 311 lines of the barber pole pattern.
</OL>

<H2>DISK PACK</H2>

<P>This demo will take data from a magnetic tape and format that onto a disk pack,
and then read that disk pack and print the records on the line printer.

<OL>
<LI>Open/raise the MagTape window and mount the file "barberpole.mti" on
tape drive 000.
<LI>Open/raise the Disks window and mount a new file on disk drive 000.
<LI>Select menu File->Assemble and choose the file "dsktest1.ezc" and click "Assemble".
<LI>Press RUN. The tape drive should show about 25192 characters read. The disk drive should
show current position "0.6" for cylinder 0 track 6.
<LI>Select menu File->Assemble and choose the file "dsktest2.ezc" and click "Assemble".
<LI>Press RUN. The disk drive should momentarily show "0" and then
advance to final position "0.6". The line printer 
should have printed the 311-line barber pole pattern.
</OL>

<H2>FORTRAN CHARACTER CONVERSION</H2>

<P>This demo will print a punch card deck containing a FORTRAN IV program
that was punched based on symbols printed by IBM card punches,
not the Honeywell symbols. This program consults the SENSE 1 switch to
see whether or not to convert special characters (using a MAT instruction).

<OL>
<LI>Open/raise the PunchCards window and mount the file "prog3.pcd" in
the Read Hopper.
<LI>Select menu File->Assemble and choose the file "rdrtest.ezc" and click "Assemble".
<LI>Press RUN. The short program-segment should be printed on the line printer -
although many of the special characters will appear wrong for FORTRAN program
syntax.
<LI>It will be necessary to re-mount the card deck, in order to start over for
the next step.
<LI>Select menu File->Assemble and choose the file "rdrtest.ezc" and click "Assemble".
<LI>Press the SENSE 1 switch (it should now be lighted).
<LI>Press RUN. The short program-segment should be printed again,
this time the FORTRAN special characters should appear as expected.
</OL>

<H2>RUN TAPE</H2>

<P>This demo will create a "run tape" and then use BOOTSTRAP to run it.

<OL>
<LI>Select menu File->Assemble and choose the file "mcetests.ezc",
check the "Tape Image" box, and click "Assemble". This will create "mcetests.mti".
<LI>Open/raise the MagTape window and mount the file "mcetests.mti" on tape drive 000.
<LI>Enter 40 into Contents (using the clear button as needed).
<LI>Ensure Address is 0 (use the clear button as needed).
<LI>Press BOOTSTRAP. The tape drive should indicate that about 191 bytes were read.
<LI>Press RUN. The tape drive should stop at about 1828 bytes and the line printer
should show the output of running the mcetests program.
</OL>
