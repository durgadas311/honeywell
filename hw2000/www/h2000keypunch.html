<H2>Details of Keypunch Differences</H2>

<P>The Honeywell character set is based on (an extension of) the 48-character
set of an IBM 026-H keypunch (except for apostrophy).
This is due to the character set being decided/fixed
prior to appearance of the IBM 029 keypunch, which defined a full 64-character set.
Even if cards are punched on an IBM 026-H, the "special code" option needs
to be set with the PCB instruction in order to get the correct representation for
the plus and minus characters. It seems that FORTRAN IV programs were normally
punched on an IBM 026-H keypunch, and the compiler likely used the "special code"
option to read the program. It is not known if Honeywell built keypunch machines and,
if so, what character set was used.

<P>The IBM 026 (introduced 1949) had several options that changed the
keycaps and printing of some of the special characters. The -H option was
generally used for FORTRAN IV programming, since it supplied the necessary
special characters. The IBM 029 (introduced 1964) extended the character set of the 026-A,
assigning new codes for the additional characters of the 026-H,
and so created a conversion issue if both 029 and 026-H keypunches were being used.
It was my experience that using an IBM 029 for FORTRAN programs on an H2040 required
the keypunch operator to understand that certain characters had to be punched
using different symbols.
The IBM 029 was available with a 48-character (026-compatible) option,
in either the -A or -H arrangements, however I never saw those.
Since the special characters of the -H option did not conflict with
the corresponding characters of the 029, it is also possible that the
FORTRAN compiler simply folded both possible punch codes into the same
character.
The related example demonstrates a way to automatically
convert, provided all cards in a program were punched for the same character set.
