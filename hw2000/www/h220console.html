<BODY>
The model 220 console is a simple text input/output device.
This implementation uses a window to represent the printed paper,
and keyboard focus on that window to input data.
There is a TYPE indicator on the menu bar, which will light when
a PDT instruction (to address 47) is waiting for input to be typed.

<P>
The device is at the traditional address of 07/47. Without more information,
this implementation stops printing from a PDT before the RM (character at
RM is not printed).  This also means that if the first character has a RM, nothing is printed.
The PDT control character C3 determins whether the output is terminated
with a Carriage Return (and Line Feed). An automatic CR/LF is inserted after reaching column 64.

<P>The console window is hidden by default. It may be made visible,
and raised to the top, using the Front Panel menu "I/O" and selecting Console.
Closing the console window only hiddes it, no output is lost or changed.
A program that prints to the console will cause it to be made visible,
if not already.

<P>
Keyboard input is transferred until a Carriage Return (Enter) or until a RM is sensed.
The PDT C3 control character for input is currently ignored. Each keystroke
is also printed (echoed) without computer intervention.

<P>Menus allow for saving the current output (printed) buffer to a file,
or discarding all current output (Tear Off).

<P>The following translations from ASCII keystrokes to Honeywell special characters
are made:
<TABLE BORDER>
<TR><TH>ASCII</TH><TH>Honeywell</TH></TR>
<TR><TD ALIGN=CENTER>^</TD><TD ALIGN=CENTER>&#162;</TD></TR>
<TR><TD ALIGN=CENTER>[</TD><TD ALIGN=CENTER>&#9633;</TD></TR>
<TR><TD ALIGN=CENTER>]</TD><TD ALIGN=CENTER>&#9632;</TD></TR>
<TR><TD ALIGN=CENTER>~</TD><TD ALIGN=CENTER>credit (&#169;)</TD></TR>
<TR><TD ALIGN=CENTER>\</TD><TD ALIGN=CENTER>&#8800;</TD></TR>
</TABLE>

<P>The "console typewriter" also functions as an extension to the control panel.
The real H2000-series systems had a limited control panel and relied on the
typewriter for some operations. The following is supported on the typewriter,
when the system is in the STOP mode:

<TABLE BORDER>
<TR><TH>Command</TH><TH>Purpose</TH></TR>
<TR><TD>A <I>adr chr</I>...</TD><TD>Place <I>chr</I>(s) in memory starting at <I>adr</I>. Values may include punctuation (8-bit octal).</TD></TR>
<TR><TD>P <I>ctl</I></TD><TD>Print contents of Control Register <I>ctl</I></TD></TR>
<TR><TD>B <I>per adr</I></TD><TD>Bootstrap from peripheral address <I>per</I> into memory at <I>adr</I></TD></TR>
<TR><TD>R</TD><TD>Print contents of AAR and BAR</TD></TR>
<TR><TD>S</TD><TD>Single-step (same as INSTRUCT button)</TD></TR>
<TR><TD>L <I>text</I></TD><TD>Log </I>text</I> (used to put information on paper but not input to computer)</TD></TR>
</TABLE>

<P>All numbers are input/output in octal. In this mode, the console will automatically
insert blanks into commands when certain obvious limits are reached.
These commands also update the control panel Contents, Address, and Control values
as appropriate.

<P>Documentation of this control mode is very limited, so the above is only a guess.
