<BODY>
The model 220 console is a simple text input/output device.
This implementation uses a window to represent the printed paper,
and keyboard focus on that window to input data.
<P>
The device is at the traditional address of 07/47. Without more information,
this implementation stops printing from a PDT before the RM (character at
RM is not printed).  This also means that if the first character has a RM, nothing is printed.
The PDT control character C3 determins whether the output is terminated
with a Carriage Return (and Line Feed). An automatic CR/LF is inserted after reaching column 80 (it is not known what the actual carriage width of the 220 was).

<P>The console window is hidden by default. It may be made visible,
and raised to the top, using the Front Panel menu "I/O" and selecting Console.
Closing the console window only hiddes it, no output is lost or changed.
A program that prints to the console will cause it to be made visible,
if not already.

<P>
Keyboard input is transferred until a Carriage Return (Enter) or until a RM is sensed.
The PDT C3 control character for input is currently ignored. Each keystroke
is also printed (echoed) without computer intervention.

<P>Menus allow for saving the current output (printed) buffer to a file,
or discarding all current output (Tear Off).

<P>The following translations from ASCII keystrokes to Honeywell special characters
are made:
