<P>
The model 214 punch/reader is a input/output device that uses full 12-punch codes.
This implementation uses a window to represent the device.
The device is a single-path punch card handler:
Cards are taken from the input hopper, optionally read, optionally punched,
and finally deposited at the output stacker. Punching a card, when no card was previously
read, will cause a card to be loaded from the input and by-pass the reader.
<P>
The device is at the traditional address of 01/41.
PDT instructions always operate on a full card, reegardless of any RM in memory.
However, transfer of characters stops at RM (or after column 80).

<P>The PunchCard window is hidden by default. It may be made visible,
and raised to the top, using the Front Panel menu "I/O" and selecting PunchCard.
Closing the window only hides it, having no effect on the operation of the devices.

<P>This device operates similar to the original equipment, in the sense that it
will stall a PDT instruction if there are no cards in the input hopper.
If a program wants to detect the end of a card desk, there must be
a special card to indicate the end, such as "1EOF&#916;", and the
program must recognize the card and stop reading.

<P>The "Input Hopper" button selects a file to be used to supply "cards" to the
reader. Card files may be "stacked" much the way punch card decks could be
stacked in the hopper. The current set of card decks may be removed/replaced
by clicking the "Remove All" checkbox before accepting the next file.
Blank cards may be selected by clicking the BLANK button and optionally
entering the number of blank cards to add.
Clicking "Cancel" will make no changes to the input hopper.

<P>The "Output Stacker" button selects a file to be used to store punched
(or read) "cards", otherwise output cards will be discarded.
Any cards in the output stacker prior to selecting a file will be lost.
In other words, the output stacker file must be set before passing any cards
through the device that need to be saved.
Note that input file(s) are never altered, so having output set to "Discard"
will not affect a punch card deck (file) on the input hopper.

<P>The number of cards in the input hopper and output stacker is shown,
along with a visual representation of the respective card stacks.
A red line on top of a stack indicates more cards than can be shown,
however there are no physical limitations on the number of cards
on the input hopper or output stacker - unlike original equipment.

<P>The START, STOP, and RUNOUT buttons should behave similar to the original
equipment.  The RUNOUT button may be necessary under
certain conditions to flush all cards through the device, especially
when an output stacker file is set.

<P>File format consists of two bytes representing each card column. The two bytes form
a 16-bit word, where only the low-order 12 bits are used. These 12 bits are
interpreted as the punch card zones, with bit 11 being zone 12, bit 10 being
zone 11, bit 9 being zone 0, and so forth with bit 0 being zone 9.

<P>The is also an application "CardPunch.jar" which may be used to create
decks of cards, using an interface similar to original keypunch equipment.
