<P>
The model 214 punch/reader is a input/output device that uses full 12-punch codes.
This implementation uses a window to represent the device.
<P>
The device is at the traditional address of 01/41.
PDT instructions always operate on a full card, reegardless of any RM in memory.

<P>
The "Read Hopper" button selects a file to be used to supply "cards" to the
reader. The "Punch Hopper" button selects a file to be used to store punched "cards"
(not as a suppply of pre-punched cards to be over-punched - that is currently not supported).
Active reader or punch will show the number of cards processed for the given file.
File format consists of two bytes representing each card column. The two bytes form
a 16-bit word, where only the low-order 12 bits are used. These 12 bits are
interpreted as the punch card zones, with bit 11 being zone 12, bit 10 being
zone 11, bit 9 being zone 0, and so forth with bi 0 being zone 9.
