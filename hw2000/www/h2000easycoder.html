<BODY>

<P>The Easycoder assembler used here is actually a cross-assembler
that is built-in to the Virtual H2000. It currently implements a lot,
but not all, of the features described for OS/2000.
<P>Supported assembler directives:
<DL>
<DT>PROG</DT><DD></DD>
<DT>ADMODE</DT><DD></DD>
<DT>ORG</DT><DD></DD>
<DT>MORG</DT><DD></DD>
<DT>DCW</DT><DD></DD>
<DT>DC</DT><DD></DD>
<DT>RESV</DT><DD>also supports RESV,fill form</DD>
<DT>DSA</DT><DD>supports only a single address</DD>
<DT>EQU</DT><DD></DD>
<DT>END</DT><DD></DD>
</DL>
<P>It is not known if all possible operands will work with the
above directives.
<P>In addition, all of the punctuation modifiers (Set I and Set II) are
supported.
<P>It also supports indirect and indexed addressing.

<P>None of the pseudo-opcode forms are currently supported, that is, the
short-hand instructions for specific variant character values.

<P>This assembler is a crude two-pass assembler.
It should, however, detect re-definition of (duplicate instances) labels
as well as undefined labels.
Error handling is also not perfect. In some cases, assembly continues.
In others, it will abort.

<P>Extended labels are not supported.
<P>The CLEAR directive is not supported, mainly because it is not yet
known how those commands are deferred to load time.

<P>The assembler, or rather the front panel which runs the assembler,
may need help to fully understand a program's memory range. If the
program uses a block of memory that is not specifically reserved or defined,
it may be necessary to mark that boundary. For example, the "machin.ezc"
program has a label "TOP" which specifies the highest memory location
it will use. Just prior to the END directive, there is an ORG TOP
and a RESV 1 to provide the necessary boundary.
