<P>
The model 274 disk drives (any similar model controller) implements
"random access" storage.
This implementation uses a window to provide basic control for the 8 drives.
<P>
The device is at the traditional address of 04/44.
Some details are lacking regarding various command specifics.
The following has been assumed, until more information is available:
<UL>
<LI>READ/WRITE INITIAL commmands will format record(s) beginning with the
index point on the track. Record address information is provided with
record data.
<LI>READ/WRITE (plain) commmands will format record(s) beginning with the
current point on the track. Record address information is provided with
record data.
<LI>SEARCH AND READ/WRITE commmands will locate the record identified in
the address register and read/write data only.
<LI>SEARCH AND READ/WRITE NEXT commmands will increment the record number and
locate the record identified in
the address register and read/write data only.
<LI>EXTENDED versions operate on more than one record, governed by the
size of the buffer (RM in memory). This variation of the command, in the case
of SEARCH AND versions, will follow Track Linking Records automatically.
</UL>

<P>Disk geometry is set as 203 cylinders of 20 tracks (heads, surfaces)
with 4700 raw characters
per track. Each record consumes 11 additional characters to the record length.
Raw capacity of a disk pack is 19 million characters.
The image file format consists of 4060 blocks of 4700 bytes each, representing
the tracks. The first 20 blocks (tracks) represent the first cylinder. 
Within a track, data is laid out starting with a 1-byte Address Mark followed
by the header (FCCTTRRDL) followed by a 1-byte Data Mark, then DL bytes of
data followed by either another Address Mark or an "end of track mark".
Bytes from the End Mark to 4700th byte are ignored, although format commands
can write there. The file size grows as tracks get formatted, with "non-existent"
data effectively being "unformatted".

<P>Each drive has a mount/unmount button that is labeled for the
drive number (000 - 007). Clicking this button opens a file dialog window
for selecting the disk image to be mounted (clicking Cancel will leave no
image mounted).
In addition, "A" and "B" buttons exist to provide values to match
against the A-File and B-File bits in record headers. Since no information
has been found on how these bits were used on real hardware,
use of these bits is currently not implemented.
<P>Active drives will show current head position/selection
as Cylinder.Track.
