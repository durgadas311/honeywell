<BODY>
The model 274 disk drives (any simmilar model controller) implements
"random access" storage.
This implementation uses a window to provide basic control for the 8 drives.
<P>
The device is at the traditional address of 04/44.
Some details are lacking regarding various command specifics.
The following has been assumed, until more information is available:
<UL>
<LI>READ/WRITE INITIAL commmands will format record(s) beginning with the
index point on the track. Record address information is provided with
record data.
<LI>READ/WRITE (plain) commmands will format record(s) beginning with the
current point on the track. Record address information is provided with
record data.
<LI>SEARCH AND READ/WRITE commmands will locate the record identified in
the address register and read/write data only.
<LI>SEARCH AND READ/WRITE NEXT commmands will increment the record number and
locate the record identified in
the address register and read/write data only.
<<LI>EXTENDED versions operate on more than one record, governed by the
size of the buffer (RM in memory). Thhe variation of the command, in the case
of SEARCH AND versions, will follow Track Linking Records automatically.
</UL>

<P>Disk geometry as set as 203 cylinders of 20 tracks with 4700 raw characters
per track. Each record consumes 11 additional characters to the record length.
Raw capacity is 19 million characters.

<P>Each drive has a "mount/unmount" button that is labeled for the
drive number (000 - 007). Clicking this button opens a file dialog window
for selecting the disk image to be mounted (pressing Cancel will leave no
image mounted).
In addition, "A" and "B" buttons exist to provide values to match
against the A-File and B-File bits in record headers.
<P>Active drives will show current head position/selection
as Cylinder.Track.
