<P>
The model 274 disk drives (any similar model controller) implements
"random access" storage.
This implementation uses a window to provide basic control for the 8 drives.
<P>
The device is at the traditional address of 04/44.
Some details are lacking regarding various command specifics.

<P>The Disks window is hidden by default. It may be made visible,
and raised to the top, using the Front Panel menu "I/O" and selecting Disks.
Closing the window only hides it, having no effect on the operation of the drives.

<P>Due to lack of detailed information about these devices,
the following has been assumed until more information is available:
<UL>
<LI>READ/WRITE INITIAL commmands will format record(s) beginning with the
index point on the track. Record address information is provided with
record data.
<LI>READ/WRITE (plain) commmands will format record(s) beginning with the
current point on the track. Record address information is provided with
record data.
<LI>SEARCH AND READ/WRITE commmands will locate the record identified in
the address register and read/write data only.
<LI>SEARCH AND READ/WRITE NEXT commmands will increment the record number and
locate the record identified in
the address register and read/write data only.
<LI>EXTENDED versions operate on more than one record, governed by the
size of the buffer (RM in memory). This variation of the command, in the case
of SEARCH AND versions, will follow Track Linking Records automatically.
<LI>A transfer of 0 characters,
with no error indicated, implies that
there are no more records in the cylinder (end of TLR chain).
</UL>

<P>The description of PDT for Disk Devices shows no method of selecting a
disk drive (C3 is used for the command, and no other control characters
are defined). The PCB instruction does define commands that select a drive.
It is currently being assumed that the PCB drive selection persists
and is used by PDT instructions. This requires the programmer to use
a PCB instruction before any (drive related) PDT instruction.
The "check device busy" operation (C3=0D) seems to be a likely candidate.
What is not clear is just how this context relates to RWC, control, and drive.
If there is only one Address Register, in the control, then only one drive
can be busy at a time - regardless of use of RWC. However, if each drive
has it's own Address Register (or each RWC), then multiple disk operations
can be active, if they are tied to separate RWCs. At the moment, the control
is assumed to be the bottle-neck and only one disk operation can be active
at a time (i.e. the control has the Address Register as well as drive selector).
The programmer must ensure that multiple disk operations do not collide.

<P>Disk geometry is set as 203 cylinders of 20 tracks (heads, surfaces)
with 4700 raw characters
per track. Each record consumes 11 additional characters to the record length.
Raw capacity of a disk pack is 19 million characters.
The image file format consists of 4060 blocks of 4700 bytes each, representing
the tracks. The first 20 blocks (tracks) represent the first cylinder. 
Within a track, data is laid out starting with a 1-byte Address Mark followed
by the header (FCCTTRRDL) followed by a 1-byte Data Mark, then DL bytes of
data followed by either another Address Mark or an "end of track mark".
Bytes from the End Mark to 4700th byte are ignored, although format commands
can write there. The file size grows as tracks get formatted, with "non-existent"
data effectively being "unformatted".

<P>Each drive has a mount/unmount button that is labeled for the
drive number (000 - 007). Clicking this button opens a file dialog window
for selecting the disk image to be mounted (clicking Cancel will leave no
image mounted).
In addition, "A" and "B" buttons exist to provide values to match
against the A-File and B-File bits in record headers. Since no information
has been found on how these bits were used on real hardware,
use of these bits is currently not implemented.
<P>Active drives will show current head position/selection
as Cylinder.Track.
