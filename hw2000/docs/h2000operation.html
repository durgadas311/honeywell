<P><A HREF="h2000frontpanel.html">Notes on operating the Front Panel</A>

<P> Menus are as follows:
<UL>
<LI>File: Assemble a program or assemble the monitor.
<LI>I/O: Control visibility of I/O device windows. Device windows that are
hidden or obscured may be raised by selecting the device.
<LI>Debug: Some debug features.
</UL>

<B>File</B>
<UL><B>FORTRAN</B>
<UL>(Optional) Compile a <A HREF="h2000fortran4.html">FORTRAN IV</A> program,
and assemble resulting code
into memory for running. This option only exists if there is the
<CODE>Fortran4Embedded.jar</CODE> file on the classpath (typically in the
current directory or location of H2000.jar). </UL>
<B>Assemble</B>
<UL>Assemble a program into memory. If the monitor has been activated,
the program will be assembled into a memory region that is relocated
above the monitor, and the monitor data structures will be filled-in
to indicate how to run the job.</UL>
<B>Monitor</B>
<UL>Assemble the monitor program and setup the Assemble option to use it.
There is a monitor program supplied in the sample programs tarball,
"monitor.ezc".
When the monitor is active, this menu option will be disabled (grayed-out).
Clicking INITIALIZE (after STOP) will reset monitor mode.</UL>
</UL>
<B>Disk Util</B>
<UL><B>Initialize Volume</B>
<UL>Initialize a disk pack for use with MOD1 programs.
Disk packs must be mounted onto disk drives before they can be initialized.
Both FMT and DAT PERMIT switches must be ON.
Input the disk drive unit, 6-character volume name, and
6-character volume serial number.</UL>
<B>Map Volume</B>
<UL>Show contents of a MOD1 disk pack volume.
Input the disk drive unit.</UL>
<B>Allocate File</B>
<UL>Create a MOD1 disk file on a volume.
Both FMT and DAT PERMIT switches must be ON.
Input the disk drive unit, 10-character file name,
item/record/block parameters, and allocation units.</UL>
<B>Deallocate File</B>
<UL>Delete a MOD1 disk file from a volume.
The DAT PERMIT switch must be ON.
Input the disk drive unit and 10-character file name.</UL>
</UL>
<B>Debug</B>
<UL><B>Trace</B>
<UL>Trace is enabled for the range of memory of the last assembled program.
Trace output will appear on the line printer.</UL>
<B>Trace Full</B>
<UL>A dialog is presented for specifying the range of memory to trace.</UL>
<B>Trace Off</B>
<UL>Cancel any active tracing.</UL>
<B>Dump</B>
<UL>A memory dump is printed to the Line Printer for the range of memory of the last assembled program.</UL>
<B>Dump Full</B>
<UL>A dialog is presented for specifying the range of memory to dump.</UL>
</UL>

<P>The assemble dialogs have a checkbox for "Listing". This causes an assembly
listing to printed on the Line Printer, along with a dump of the symbol table.

<P>The assemble dialogs also have options for creating a Magnetic Tape Image.
This will produce a "Binary Run Tape" (BRT) with the bootstrap and loader
records. Eventually, this will be a fairly-complete "Tape Monitor/Loader C"
implementation, but right now it wraps a singe program in the self-loading
code which allows for running the program. The procedure is similar to that
described by "Tape Monitor/Loader C" documentation:
BOOTSTRAP 40 twice, then RUN <U>once</U>. The following format is used:
<OL>
<LI>"1HDR&#916;" record (skipped during bootstrap)
<LI>The loader, bootmt.mti, including bootstrap and loader records
<LI>The program image in BRT format, single segment, multiple records
<LI>"1EOF&#916;" record
<LI>Two "1ERI&#916;" records
</OL>

<P>The loader will restore punctuation based on the information in the tape image.
Such a tape image may be mounted on tape drive 000 and used with the
BOOTSTRAP and RUN buttons to load and run the program. The loader,
bootmt.mti, was created from bootstrap.ezc and brtloader.ezc in the sample programs.
These programs cannot be assembled from the front panel, as they require
a different output format than BRT.
