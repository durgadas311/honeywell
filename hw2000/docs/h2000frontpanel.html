<H3>Series 2000 Front Panel</H3>
<P>The front panel buttons should behave according to normal Honeywell
series 200/2000 operation, however the power buttons are not functional.
Buttons are not currently labeled, however
buttons that might have a less-than-obvious function should have a
"tooltip" that will appear when the mouse pointer hovers over them.
Note, as is the case for original hardware, most buttons will not function
unless the STOP indicator is on. The only exceptions are STOP and
INTERRUPT.

<P>In addition, the "console typewriter" provides some control functions, again
when the STOP indicator is on. See <A HREF="h220console.html">Model 220 Console</A>.

<H2>Display</H2>
<P>The Contents and Address indicators will light during a program run, however
updates are limited to updates about every 20mS due to JAVA GUI and video limitations.
When a stop occurs, either by clicking STOP or by executing Halt, the Contents
and Address are updated with the appropriate values.

<P>The Control address is actually the same address used by the variant character
for LCR/SCR. So, for example, SR is 77. All unspecified addresses have registers
behind them, but only the documented ones are used by the processor. These other
registers may be used as desired.  Also note that CLC/SLC registers may be accessed,
and should have values from most recent PDT instructions used on them.
In this implementation, CLC and SLC contain physical addresses, so for programs
running under the monitor they will have the relocated address, not the
address used by the program instructions. This means that examining memory
from the front panel using these registers will have the desired results.

<H2>Debug Buttons</H2>

<P>The CONTENTS buttons represent an 8-bit register that normally shows the contents
of a memory location, including punctuation. A lighted button indicates a "1" bit
(dark buttons indicate "0" bits).
";" is the Item Mark bit, "," is the Word Mark bit (both "1" mean Record Mark).
Changing this register does not alter any memory location,
unless/until the ENTER button is pressed. The bits of this register may be
set to a "1" by pressing the corresponding button, but setting bits to "0" requires using
the CLEAR button on the far left.

<P>The CONTENTS ENTER button (far upper right, downward pointing arrow)
will cause the value of the CONTENTS register to be written to the memory location
indicated by the ADDRESS register. Note: protection, relocation, etc. does not apply.
The CONTENTS DISPLAY button (upward pointing arrow) will copy the memory location
indicated by the ADDRESS register into the CONTENTS register.

<P>The ADDRESS buttons represent a 19-bit register that normally shows the
address of a memory location. A lighted button indicates a "1" bit
(dark buttons indicate "0" bits).
Changing this register does not alter any control memory register,
unless/until the CONTROL ENTER button is pressed.
The bits of this register may be set to a "1" by pressing the corresponding button,
but setting bits to "0" requires using the CLEAR button on the far left.

<P>The CONTROL ENTER button (far middle right, downward pointing arrow)
will cause the value of the ADDRESS register to be written to the control memory register
indicated by the CONTROL register.
The CONTROL DISPLAY buttons (plain, +1, -1) will copy the control memory register
indicated by the CONTROL register and also perform a CONTENTS DISPLAY action.
The +1 and -1 also do a <U>post</U> increment/decrement
of the <U>control memory register</U>.

<P>The CONTROL buttons represent a 6-bit register that holds the address of
a control memory register. This is the same as the variant character used
for SCR/LCR instructions to access the register. Lighted buttons are "1",
dark buttons are "0". The buttons will toggle the state of the respective bit,
so no CLEAR button is required.
<P>Control registers are defined <A HREF="h2000cr.html">here</A>.
<P>This implementation provides register memory for all 64 control memory locations.
Work registers are not used by this implementation and so may be used for any purpose
on the front panel, for example to examine a range of memory locations
(DISPLAY +1, DISPLAY -1) without disturbing registers used by the program
(allowing the program to continue to run).
<P>ACC registers are actually shadows of the real data. The
Front Panel formats real data into these registers when CONTROL DISPLAY
accesses them, and endeavors to update real data when CONTROL ENTER is pressed.
Note that updating ACC registers using CONTROL ENTER is not likely to have good results.

<P>At least in this implementation (if not on original hardware), the AAR, BAR, and SR
registers contain "logical" program addresses. In other words, if the program
being examined is running with relocation, these addresses cannot be used to
directly access their respective memory locations. They must be relocated by
adding the contents of the BRR. It is not known if/where the BRR exists in
control memory, so there is no way to access it from the front panel.
The same is true for IBR, Variant Register, AIR, etc.

<H2>220-3 Console Commands</H2>
<P>The Display and Debug Buttons of the standard control panel have been
replaced by an interactive "control mode" on the 220-3 console typewriter.
When the system is stopped, the following commands are accepted:
<P><DL>
<DT>A <I>ctl</I> <I>adr</I></DT>
<DD>Store address in control register, and load into Address Register.</DD>
<DT>P <I>ctl</I></DT>
<DD>Print contents of control register, and load into Address Register.</DD>
<DT>R</DT>
<DD>Load control register from last <B>P</B> or <B>A</B> command into Address Register,
print address and memory contents.</DD>
<DT><I>octal-triplets</I>...</DT>
<DD>Store values into memory starting at current Address Register value, increment.
This is similar to the CONTENTS ENTER but with an increment of Address Register.
The control register from last <B>P</B> or <B>A</B> command is also modified.</DD>
<DT><B>TYPE-button</B></DT>
<DD>Holding the TYPE button down causes the contents of memory to be printed
starting at the Address Register.
This is similar to using the CONTROL DISPLAY +1 button except that the function
repeats as long as the TYPE button is held down.
The control register from last <B>P</B> or <B>A</B> command is also modified.</DD>
<DT>B <I>per</I> <I>adr</I></DT>
<DD>Bootstrap using the peripheral address and memory address.
This is similar to entering <I>per</I> into CONTENTS, <I>adr</I> into ADDRESS,
and pressing BOOTSTRAP.</DD>
<DT>S</DT>
<DD>Single step one instruction. This is similar to using the INSTRUCT button.</DD>
<DT>L <I>text</I></DT>
<DD>Log text to the page. This is the console equivalent of a comment in EasyCoder.</DD>
</DL>
<P>Addresses and entered/printed as 7 octal digits, first digit 0 or 1.
Control registers and peripheral addresses are 2 octal digits.
Octal-triplets are 3 digit octal representations of 8 bit bytes.
The commands will print spaces at appropriate points, and will automatically
execute when the last valid digit is entered. Pressing Carriage Return before
that point will cancel the command (or the current octal-triplet).


<H2>System Control Buttons</H2>

<P>Most of these buttons are fairly obvious. RUN starts the processor executing
instructions at the current SR. STOP halts the processor (after current instruction
completes). INTERRUPT sets a Console/Front-Panel interrupt.
TYPE button (220-3 only) is explained above.

<P>Pressing STOP and INITIALIZE together is not possible on the GUI,
so holding down the Shift key while clicking STOP is the equivalent.
This combination will stop infinitely running instruction fetch or execution,
as well as I/O.

<P>INITIALIZE will reset nearly everything related to the hardware.
This includes peripheral devices and RWCs.
Note that clicking the STOP button while holding Shift down will also
perform INITIALIZE.

<P>SYSTEM CLEAR does not currently do anything. The original intent seemed to be
to reset the processor to the "extraction state", but this implementation does
not leave the virtual process in a state that requires any reset.

<P>INSTRUCT provides a single-step function. Pressing this button causes
one instruction to be executed.

<P>BOOTSTRAP (220-1 only) provides a more complicated function. It will execute a PDT
instruction using ADDRESS as the A-Field and CONTENTS as the C2 control character.
This implementation will use 11 as the C1 control character (RWC), and the device
selected by C2 will provide "reasonable" defaults for any other control characters
required. For example, Magnetic Tape (C2 = 40) will choose
tape drive 000, READ FORWARD, 4x3 9-TRACK record mark termination.
At the end of a BOOTSTRAP, all of BAR, AAR, and SR will contain the value from ADDRESS.
The intent is that the load address of the bootstrap code is the same as the start/run
address for the bootstrap. The operator may, of course, change the SR (or any other
registers) prior to pressing RUN.

<P>Address Mode buttons "2", "3", and "4" set the (initial) address mode
for the next RUN or INSTRUCT.
