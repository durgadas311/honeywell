<P>
The model 214 punch/reader is a input/output device that uses full 12-punch codes.
This implementation uses a window to represent the device.
The device is a single-path punch card handler:
Cards are taken from the input hopper, optionally read, optionally punched,
and finally deposited at the output stacker. Punching a card, when no card was previously
read, will cause a card to be loaded from the input and by-pass the reader.
<P>
The device is at the traditional address of 01/41.
PDT instructions always operate on a full card, reegardless of any RM in memory.
However, transfer of characters stops at RM (or after column 80).

<P>The PunchCard window is hidden by default. It may be made visible,
and raised to the top, using the Front Panel menu "I/O" and selecting PunchCard.
Closing the window only hides it, having no effect on the operation of the devices.

<P>This device operates similar to the original equipment, in the sense that it
will stall a PDT instruction if there are no cards in the input hopper.
If a program wants to detect the end of a card desk, there must be
a special card to indicate the end, such as "1EOF&#916;", and the
program must recognize the card and stop reading.

<P>
The "Input Hopper" button selects a file to be used to supply "cards" to the
reader. With no file selected (e.g. "Cancel" from the selection dialog),
a finite supply of blank cards is available.
The "Output Stacker" button selects a file to be used to store punched
(or read) "cards",
otherwise output cards will be discarded.
Note that an input file is not altered, so having output set to "Discard"
will not affect a punch card deck being read.
An active reader or punch will show the number
of cards remaining/punched for the given file.
The START, STOP, and RUNOUT buttons should behave similar to original
equipment.

<P>File format consists of two bytes representing each card column. The two bytes form
a 16-bit word, where only the low-order 12 bits are used. These 12 bits are
interpreted as the punch card zones, with bit 11 being zone 12, bit 10 being
zone 11, bit 9 being zone 0, and so forth with bit 0 being zone 9.

<P>The "Runout" button may be necessary under
certain conditions to flush all cards through the device.

<P>The is also an application "CardPunch.jar" which may be used to create
decks of cards, using an interface similar to original keypunch equipment.
