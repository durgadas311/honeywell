<P>
The model 214 punch/reader is a input/output device that uses full 12-punch codes.
This implementation uses a window to represent the devices.
<P>
The device is at the traditional address of 01/41.
PDT instructions always operate on a full card, reegardless of any RM in memory.

<P>The PunchCard window is hidden by default. It may be made visible,
and raised to the top, using the Front Panel menu "I/O" and selecting PunchCard.
Closing the window only hides it, having no effect on the operation of the devices.

<P>
The "Read Hopper" button selects a file to be used to supply "cards" to the
reader. The "Punch Stacker" button selects a file to be used to store punched "cards"
(not as a suppply of pre-punched cards to be over-punched -
that is currently not supported, all cards punched start as blank, new cards).
Active reader or punch will show the number of cards processed for the given file.
File format consists of two bytes representing each card column. The two bytes form
a 16-bit word, where only the low-order 12 bits are used. These 12 bits are
interpreted as the punch card zones, with bit 11 being zone 12, bit 10 being
zone 11, bit 9 being zone 0, and so forth with bit 0 being zone 9.

<P>The is also an application "CardPunch.jar" which may be used to create
decks of cards, using an interface similar to original keypunch equipment.
