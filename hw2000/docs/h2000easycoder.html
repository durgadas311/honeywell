<BODY>

<P>The Easycoder assembler used here is actually a cross-assembler
that is built-in to the Virtual H2000. It currently implements a lot,
but not all, of the features described for OS/2000.
<P>Supported assembler directives:
<UL><TABLE>
<TR><TD>PROG</TD><TD></TD></TR>
<TR><TD>SEG</TD><TD></TD></TR>
<TR><TD>ADMODE</TD><TD></TD></TR>

<TR><TD>RANGE</TD><TD>Unclear exactly how to store this in output,
perhaps a pair of "set address" control codes in BRT.</TD></TR>
<TR><TD>CLEAR</TD><TD>Only in BRT format output or immediate execution</TD></TR>
</TABLE></UL>

<P>It is not known if all possible operands will work with the
above directives.
<P>In addition, all of the punctuation modifiers (Set I and Set II) are
supported.
<P>It also supports indirect and indexed addressing.

<P>None of the pseudo-opcode forms are currently supported, that is, the
short-hand instructions for specific variant character values.

<P>This assembler is a crude two-pass assembler.
It should, however, detect re-definition (duplicate instances) of labels
as well as undefined labels.
Error handling is also not perfect. In some cases, assembly continues.
In others, it will abort.

<P>"Alternate card format" (symbolic tags of up to ten characters, "A" in PROG col 75)
is not supported.

<P>In general, any features not described in the Programmer's Reference Manual
are not supported, since the detailed Easycoder documentation is not available.

<P>The assembler, or rather the front panel which runs the assembler,
may need help to fully understand a program's memory range. If the
program uses a block of memory that is not specifically reserved or defined,
it may be necessary to mark that boundary. For example, the "machin.ezc"
program has a label "TOP" which specifies the highest memory location
it will use. Just prior to the END directive, there is an ORG TOP
and a RESV 1 to provide the necessary boundary. The RANGE directive is intended for
this, but either method requires that this information be stored in the output
or somehow made known when the program is run. Such a method is not yet know.

<P>The following ASCII characters may be used for Honeywell special characters that
have no equivalent in 7-bit ASCII:

<TABLE BORDER>
<TR><TH>ASCII</TH><TH>Honeywell</TH></TR>
<TR><TD ALIGN=CENTER>^</TD><TD ALIGN=CENTER>&#162;</TD></TR>
<TR><TD ALIGN=CENTER>[</TD><TD ALIGN=CENTER>&#9633;</TD></TR>
<TR><TD ALIGN=CENTER>]</TD><TD ALIGN=CENTER>&#9632;</TD></TR>
<TR><TD ALIGN=CENTER>~</TD><TD ALIGN=CENTER>credit (&#169;)</TD></TR>
<TR><TD ALIGN=CENTER>\</TD><TD ALIGN=CENTER>&#8800;</TD></TR>
</TABLE>
The above translations are also done by the Model 220 Console
implementation of keyboard input.
