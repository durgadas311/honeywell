<BODY>

<P>The FORTRAN IV Compiler here runs in Java, but produces EasyCoder
assembly language source. The code generated runs the bulk of the FORTRAN
program, except for the routines normally included in the "run time" library.
The run-time library is implemented in the virtual computer, so that is a
bit of a "cheat".

<P>The compiler recognizes some of the job control cards, to customize
the results.

<P>Here is a <A HREF="fortran1.html">sample program listing and output</A>.

<P>Currently, only basic features are implemented,
and many of those only in their simpler forms.
Here is the TODO list:
<P><UL>
<LI>Statement functions
<LI>COMMON
<LI>DATA
<LI>Auto conversion of data types (promote INTEGER to REAL)
<LI>More complex/efficient implied DO loops
<LI>COMPLEX (parsed but not implemented)
<LI>EQUIVALENCE
<LI>EXTERNAL
<LI>CALL CHAINx
</UL>

<P>REAL data types are implemented according to the specifications
of the H200/H2000 Scientific Units, even though currently no native
floating point instructions are used. REALs are then stored in
a 48-bit (8 character) memory word.

<P>INTEGER data types default to 3-character precision, however the
*JOBID option "I" may be used to change that. Minimum is the address mode
(3 or 4).

<P>Address mode may be changed through the *JOBID option "M", but
setting the amount of memory to something higher that 32768.

<P>"LIST" enables output of the Easycoder assembler listing option.
Note, unlike the original compiler, this is the actual code that will run.

<P>"NOLIST" disables the memory map listing, which would display
variables, their Easycode names if different, and memory address (from Easycoder).

<P>"*DUMP" may be used to trigger a memory dump of the program
memory after the job terminates (see example output).

<P>The virtual H2000 will present a menu option "FORTRAN" (for compiling
and assembling FORTRAN programs) if there exists the JAR file
"Fortran4Embedded.jar" on the class path.
