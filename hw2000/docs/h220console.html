<BODY>
The model 220 console is a simple text input/output device.
This implementation uses a window to represent the printed paper,
and keyboard focus on that window to input data.
There is a TYPE indicator
(on the menu bar for 220-1, on control panel for 220-3),
which will light when
a PDT instruction (to address 47) is waiting for input to be typed.

<P>
The device is at the traditional address of 07/47.
This implementation stops printing from a PDT before the RM (character at
RM is not printed).
This also means that if the first character has a RM, nothing is printed.
The PDT control character C3 determins whether the output is terminated
with a Carriage Return (and Line Feed), or input terminated by RM will
cause a Carriage Return (and Line Feed).
An automatic CR/LF is inserted after reaching column 64.

<P>The console window is hidden by default. It may be made visible,
and raised to the top, using the Front Panel menu "I/O" and selecting Console.
Closing the console window only hiddes it, no output is lost or changed.
A program that prints to the console will cause it to be made visible,
if not already.

<P>
Keyboard input is transferred until a Carriage Return (Enter) or
until a RM is sensed. The last character (if not Carriage Return)
is placed in memory at the RM.
The PDT C3 control character determines whether a Carriage Return
is inserted when RM is sensed.
Each keystroke is also printed (echoed) without computer intervention.

<P>Note the difference between RM handling on input vs. output. Output
stops before printing the character with RM, input stops after placing
a character at RM. This is consistent, though, with RM handling for
Magnetic Tape devices.

<P>Menus allow for saving the current output (printed) buffer to a file,
or discarding all current output (Tear Off).

<P>The following translations from ASCII keystrokes to Honeywell special characters
are made:

<P>The "console typewriter" also functions as an extension to the control panel.
The real H2000-series systems (220-3 consoles) had a limited control panel
and relied on the
typewriter for some operations. The following is supported on the typewriter,
when the system is in the STOP mode:

<TABLE BORDER>
<TR><TH>Command</TH><TH>Purpose</TH></TR>
<TR><TD>A <I>ctl</I> <I>adr</I></TD><TD>Place <I>adr</I> in control register <I>ctl</I> and Address Register.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD>L <I>text</I></TD><TD>Log </I>text</I> (used to put information on paper but not input to computer). Equivalent to LOG button on 220-1 consoles.</TD></TR>
</TABLE>

<P>All numbers are input/output in octal.
<I>ctl</I> and <I>per</I> are 2-digit octal numbers.
<I>adr</I> is a 7-digit octal number where the first digit must be 0 or 1.
<I>octal-triplets</I> are 3-digit octal numbers where the first digit must be 0-3.
In this mode, the console will automatically
insert blanks or carriage-returns into commands when certain obvious limits are reached.
These commands also update the control panel Contents, Address, and Control values
as appropriate. Pressing carriage-return before command is complete will cancel
the command and take no action. In the case of entering <I>octal-triplets</I>,
only the last (current) character is cancelled.

<P><I>ctl</I> (control registers) are described <A HREF="h2000cr.html">here</A>.

<P>"Control Mode" console operation is based on "Model 120 Equipment Operators Manual"
(Honeywell document 278), extended for series 2000 systems.

<P>The <B>TYPE-button</B> is only available on the 220-3 control panel.
The LOG button/indicator is only present on the 220-1 console.

<P>The "data termination interrupt" function is assumed to mean the end of input
(pressing carriage return, or entering too many characters for the buffer).
The (non-differentiated) interrupt function is assumed to mean completion
of a buffer of output characters.
The INTERRUPT button causes a specific, separate, EI and is not part of the
peripheral control interrupt scheme.
Documentation is not clear on these.
