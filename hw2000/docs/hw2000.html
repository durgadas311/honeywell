<H3>Virtual Honeywell computer based on Series 2000 Hardware</H3>

<P>
Implements a "fully loaded" system: 512K memory,
All instructions including Scientific Unit,
Memory protection and relocation.

<P>Documentation states that a Type 220-3/6/8 console is required on all Series 2000 Systems,
which likely means that a full-feature front panel never existed.
If the java program is started with a "220-3" on the commandline,
then a minimal control panel will be used -
similar to the one provided on the 220-3 console.

<P>
Details of the BOOTSTRAP button and console 'B' command are described
<A HREF="h2000boot.html">here</A>.
There is a mag tape bootstrap loader program that the
assembler can use to create a mag tape image of a program, which can be run via BOOTSTRAP.
When selecting a file to assemble, check the "Tape Image" box. This will result in a ".mti"
file being created, complete with loader, header, and punctuation repair blocks.
Note, programs used with this loader must be ORG'ed (at least) at 1340 (decimal).
The program "mcetests.ezc" can be assembled with this option, and yields an image that
can be mounted on Tape Drive Unit 000 and used with the BOOTSTRAP function. Use a boot address of 0.
