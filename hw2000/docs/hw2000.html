<H3>Virtual Honeywell computer based on Series 2000 Hardware</H3>

<P>Implements a "fully loaded" system: 512K memory,
All instructions including Scientific Unit,
Memory protection and relocation.

<P>Documentation states that a Type 220 console is required on all Series 2000 Systems,
which likely means that a full-feature front panel never existed. However,
the appeal of such direct control over the system, and lack of any information
about the software that ran the 220 consoles, justifies this deviation from
authenticity.
