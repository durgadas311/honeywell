<H2>Virtual IBM Punch Card Data Processing</H2>

<P>This set of simulations is intended to demonstrate what
data processing was like in the early decades of the computer era,
prior to the arrival of affordable general-purpose computers.
In many cases, some or all of these practices continued even at
sites that had computers, partly because of established procedures
but also because time on the computer was expensive and reserved
for tasks that could not readily be handled by standard punch
card data processing equipment.
