<H3>Reproducing Punch Machine Help</H3>

<P>This is currently a minimal implementation of the IBM 514
Reproducing Punch machines, also used as Summary Punch for
the IBM 402 Accounting Machine.

<P>The read hopper is located in the upper left, and the punch hopper in
the upper middle.
Read output stacker is in the lower middle, and punch stacker in the lower right.
The program panel is implemented as a properties file.
currently, this file must be edited external from the simulation.
The START, STOP, and RESET buttons should function as on original equipment,
with the exception that switches do not require holding down.
The run rate is set to 20 cards per second.

<P>Comparing magnets may be viewed in the opening between the two stackers.
Control switches are located to the left of the stackers.

<P>The hoppers/stackers are set to show 100 cards, with each card represented
by a line of pixels. More cards may be in the hopper/stackers, in fact
there is no practical limit (unlike original equipment). When a hopper/stacker
has exceeded its display limit, there will be a red line on top of the stack.

<P>Clicking on an input hopper will start a dialog to add a PCD file to the hopper.
By default, this will add the new file after all existing files in the hopper,
but the option "Remove All" may be used to clear the hopper first.
Right clicking on a hopper will load blank cards.
Shift+Right-click on a hopper will empty it (to help with card runout).

<P>Clicking on a stacker will start a dialog to save the cards.
Right clicking on a stacker will empty it.

<P>Programming is done by a "properties" file, that contains lines of the
format "name = value". Referencing the original equipment programming panel,
the following are supported:

<P>Notes:

<P>Property names are expected to represent ENTRY hubs, and generally do not contain
a width (field width is determined by source(s)).

<P>In the property value, a set of hubs (a field) may be designated by adding an
asterisk and the number of hubs in the field. It is generally expected that all
sets of hubs in a given property will be the same width, and that width determines
the property width.

<P>Single items (cycles, controls, etc) must not have a field width specified.

<P>Selectors do not have a limit on positions (contact sets).
<I>N</I> may be any practical number (CO-SELECTORS are not needed).
The position numbers should start at "1" and be kept contiguous.
Keep in mind that related C, N, and T contacts must have the same position number.
