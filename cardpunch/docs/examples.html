<H3>Punch Card Data Processing Examples</H3>

<H4>Overview</H4>

<P>This set of examples takes you through a typical data processing
sequence for a company. The card deck "master1.pcd" contains a set
of customer "master" cards, each containing static information about a customer
along with that customer's current balance.
Credit balances are indicated by an "X" punch ('&' character) in column 40.
These cards are kept in sorted order by customer ID, as a convenience.
The file "detail1.pcd" contains customer transactions (e.g. purchases and
payments).
Payments are indicated by an "X" punch ('&' character) in column 40.
These cards are not sorted, as they typically would come straight from
data entry where they were punched from paper invoices - which were likely
processed in chronological order, plus possibly punched by several different
operators and then arbitrarely combined.

<P>In order to process a month's transactions, first the detail cards
need to be sorted by customer ID (using the sorter).
Then, the detail cards and master cards need to be merged such that
each customer card is followed by their transaction cards (using the collator).
Finally, this combined deck of master-detail cards is passed through
the accounting machine to produce a report and also to punch new customer
master cards with updated balances (on the summary punch). These new
customer master cards become the input for the next month's processing.
The original master and details cards might be archived, but are
otherwise not normally used again.

<H4>The Data</H4>

The customer master cards ("master1") contain data in the following format:
<P><TABLE BORDER>
<TR><TH>Columns</TH><TH>Contents</TH></TR>
<TR><TD>1-4</TD><TD>Customer ID (numeric)</TD></TR>
<TR><TD>5-19</TD><TD>First name (alphabetic)</TD></TR>
<TR><TD>20-34</TD><TD>Last name (alphabetic)</TD></TR>
<TR><TD>35-39</TD><TD>Zip code (numeric)</TD></TR>
<TR><TD>40</TD><TD>"X" punch ('&') for credit</TD></TR>
<TR><TD>41-48</TD><TD>Balance (numeric, 2 decimal positions)</TD></TR>
</TABLE>

<P>The transaction (detail) cards ("detail1") contain the following data:
<P><TABLE BORDER>
<TR><TH>Columns</TH><TH>Contents</TH></TR>
<TR><TD>1-4</TD><TD>Customer ID (numeric)</TD></TR>
<TR><TD>40</TD><TD>"X" punch ('&') for payments</TD></TR>
<TR><TD>41-48</TD><TD>Transaction Amount (numeric, 2 decimal positions)</TD></TR>
</TABLE>

<H4>Step 1 - Sort detail records</H4>
<P>Start the DataCenter application, which provides central access to all
punch-card data processing equipment.

<P>NOTE: card decks may be viewed using the "Viewer" application,
available in the "File" menu. Only saved files may be viewed, not the
contents of hoppers or stackers.

<P>Customer ID is in columns 1-4. Sorting must begin at column 4 and work
towards column 1.
<OL>
<LI>Start the Sorter. Ensure setup is for numeric sorting.
<LI>Load "detail1" into the hopper.
<LI>Set column to 4.
<LI>Press START. Once completed, ensure no cards were rejected.
<LI>Click on the pockets, ensure pockets 0-9 are selected and that
reverse picking (L-R) is NOT enabled. Set the RECYCLE option. Accept.
<LI>Set column to 3.
<LI>Repeat at step 4, reducing column by 1 each time, until completing column
1. Do not select RECYCLE for column 1 results, instead save into a new file.
The following steps assume the saved file was "detail1s".
</OL>
<H4>Step 2 - Merge master/detail records</H4>
<OL>
<LI>Start the Collator.
<LI>Load program panel "merge1".
<LI>Load "detail1s" into the SECONDARY hopper.
<LI>Load "master1" into the PRIMARY hopper.
<LI>Press START. Once the collator stops, press RUNOUT. All cards should be in
pocket/stacker 2.
<LI>Click on the pockets (stackers) and save to a new file. For this example,
the new file is assumed to be "records1".
</OL>
<H4>Step 3 - Compute new balances</H4>
<OL>
<LI>Start the Accounting Machine.
<LI>Load program panel "report1". This will cause the Reproducing Punch
(Summary Punch) to appear.
<LI>On the Reproducing Punch:
	<OL>
	<LI>Load program panel "report1".
	<LI>Make certain the REPRO switch is off.
	<LI>Load at least 50 blank cards into the punch hopper.
	</OL>
<LI>Load "records1" in the Accounting Machine hopper.
<LI>Press START on the Accounting Machine. When the machine stops, press FINAL TOTAL.
<LI>Use the "Paper" menu to save the report in a text file.
<LI>On the Reproducing Punch:
	<OL>
	<LI>Use Shift-Right-Click on the punch hopper to remove all cards.
	<LI>Press START to runout the last cards.
	<LI>Click on the punch stacker and save the cards ("master2").
	</OL>
</OL>
<P>NOTE: At this point, the new balance cards in "master2" contain only
the customer ID and new balance. Additional customer info must be transferred
from the previous master cards ("master1").

<H4>Step 4 - Copy customer information to new balance cards</H4>
<OL>
<LI>Start the Reproducing Punch (if not already).
<LI>Load program panel "master1".
<LI>Set the REPRO switch on.
<LI>Load "master1" in the read hopper.
<LI>Load "master2" (from the previous step) in the punch hopper.
<LI>Press START. If any cards are out of order (customer ID mismatch)
then a comparing error will result.
<LI>Click on the punch stacker and save the complete new balance cards.
</OL>
<P>This saved deck is now ready for input to the following month's processing.
