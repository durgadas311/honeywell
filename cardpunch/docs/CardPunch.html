</TABLE>

<P>Note, there is no "Feed" key. Pressing "Release" will feed a new card.
"Auto Feed" affects handling at the end of a card after manually punching,
or "Skip" or "Dup".

<P>The input hopper is located in the upper right corner.
Clicking on the hopper will start a dialog to add a file.
Multiple files may be stacked in the hopper.
Right-clicking on the hopper will remove any files and add 50 blank cards.
Hovering over the hopper will show the contents.

<P>The output stacker is located in the upper left corner.
Clicking on the stacker will start a dialog to save (and remove) the contents.
Shift-clicking on the stacker will pop-up the card viewer on the contents,
without disturbing the stacker.
Right clicking on the stacker will discard the contents.

<P>Located right of the stacker is an indicator of the "reading station"
status, either empty or 1 card present. This serves as a reminder to
clear this card also before saving stacker contents.

<P>Right of the reading station is the program enable lever. This effectively engages
the program "star wheels" with the program card.

<P>Above the program enable lever is the column indicator. This shows what column
will be punched next. This indicator will be yellow when the program card is
in the punching station.

<H4>Internals</H4>
<P>Punched cards are saved as 80 16-bit integers (little-endian), with bits 11-0 having
the punched rows (bit 11 = 12-Punch, bit 10 = 11-Punch, bit 9 = Zero-Punch,
... bit 0 = Nine-Punch). Bit 12 indicates whether the column should be printed
(printer was on when the column was punched, or the column was later run through
the interpreter).

<P>Note that printing does not overstrike. When a column is multi-punched, 
the printed symbol changes as punches are added. Invalid (unknown) punch
combinations are shown as blank.
