<P>"Feed" and "Release" should work similar to original equipment.
There is no "Register" key, and no pre-feeding. Feeding a card will
register it at the same time.
"Auto Feed" affects handling at the end of a card after manually punching,
"Release, "Skip" or "Dup".

<P>The input hopper is located in the upper left.
Output stacker is located in the upper right.
The hopper and stacker behave in the
<A HREF="Hoppers.html">normal fashion</A>.

<P>Located to the right of the stacker is an indicator of the "reading station"
status, either empty or 1 card present. This serves as a reminder to
clear this card also before saving stacker contents.

<P>Right of the reading station is the program enable lever. This effectively engages
the program "star wheels" with the program card.

<P>Above the program enable lever is the column indicator. This shows what column
will be punched next. This indicator will be yellow when the program card is
in the punching station.

<H4>Internals</H4>
<P>Punched cards are saved as 80 16-bit integers (little-endian), with bits 11-0 having
the punched rows (bit 11 = 12-Punch, bit 10 = 11-Punch, bit 9 = Zero-Punch,
... bit 0 = Nine-Punch). Bit 12 indicates whether the column should be printed
(printer was on when the column was punched, or the column was later run through
the interpreter).

<P>Note that printing does not overstrike. When a column is multi-punched, 
the printed symbol changes as punches are added. Invalid (unknown) punch
combinations are shown as blank.
