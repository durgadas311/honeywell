<H4>Internals</H4>
<P>Punched cards are saved as 80 16-bit integers, with bits 11-0 having
the punched rows (bit 11 = 12-Punch, bit 10 = 11-Punch, bit 9 = Zero-Punch,
... bit 0 = Nine-Punch). Bit 12 indicates whether the column should be printed
(printer was on when the column was punched, or the column was later run through
the interpreter).

<P>Note that printing does not overstrike. When a column is multi-punched, 
the printed symbol changes as punches are added. Invalid (unknown) punch
combinations are shown as blank.
