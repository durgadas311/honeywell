<H3>Punch Card Accounting Machine Help</H3>

<P>This is currently a minimal implementation of the IBM 402/403
Accounting machines.

<P>The input hopper is located in the upper left.
Output stacker is located derectly below the hopper.
The program panel is implemented as a properties file.
currently, this file must be editted external from the simulation.
The START, STOP, and FINAL TOTAL buttons should function as on original equipment,
with the exception that FINAL TOTAL does not requires simultaneous pressing of START.
The run rate is set to 20 cards per second.

<P>The hopper/stacker are set to show 100 cards, with each card represented
by a line of pixels. More cards may be in the hopper/stackers, in fact
there is no practical limit (unlike original equipment). When a hopper/stacker
has exceeded its display limit, there will be a red line on top of the stack.

<P>Clicking on the input hopper will start a dialog to add a PCD file to the hopper.
By default, this will add the new file after all existing files in the hopper,
but the option "Remove All" may be used to clear the hopper first.

<P>Clicking on the stacker will empty it. This is for appearances sake only.
Shift+Clicking on the stacker will show the cards in the Viewer, if
running from the DataCenter app.

<P>Programming is done by a "properties" file, that contains lines of the
format "name = value". Referencing the original equipment programming panel,
the following are supported:

</TABLE>

<P>Notes:
<BR>(1) Hubs are not labeled, implied that left-most is "1" if relavent.
<BR>(2) Comparator exits are chained automatically based on entry field(s).
<BR>(3) Added to property for ALPHAMERICAL/NUMERICAL PRINT entry.
<BR>(4) Item is either the EXIT or corresponding ENTRY depending on context.

<P>Property names are expected to represent ENTRY hubs, and generally do not contain
a width (field width is determined by source(s)).

<P>In the property value, a set of hubs (a field) may be designated by adding an
asterisk and the number of hubs in the field. It is generally expected that all
sets of hubs in a given property will be the same width, and that width determines
the property width.

<P>Single items (cycles, controls, etc) must not have a field width specified.

<P>Selectors do not have a limit on positions (contact sets).
<I>N</I> may be any practical number (CO-SELECTORS are not needed).
The position numbers should start at "1" and be kept contiguous.
Keep in mind that related C, N, and T contacts must have the same position number.

<P>Column Splits are bi-directional, similar to Selector positions (contacts).

<P><B>Example 1:</B> comparing a field (current and previous card). Field starts at card
column 10 and is 4 columns wide. Compare triggers "minor" group.
<UL><PRE>
c1a = 3.10*4 
c1b = 2.10*4 
stmi = c1x
</PRE>
<P>Which means to send card columns 10-13 from SECOND READING to COMPARING hubs 1-4,
and send card columns 10-13 from THIRD READING to the other COMPARING hubs 1-4.
COMPARING EXIT hubs 1-4 are linked together automatically,
and the output is tied to the MINOR START hub.
</UL>

<P><B>Example 2:</B> Add field from card column 49, 5 columns wide, to counter 8B and
print result into numeric columns 11-18 with zero suppression. Print/reset
on minor group change. Note how the 5-col field is positioned to
the lower part of the 8-digit counter.
<UL><PRE>
8b4 = 3.49*5
8bp = all
8bt = minor
n11 = 8b1*8 zero
</PRE>
<P>Line 1 sends card columns 49-53 from THIRD READING to COUNTER 8B ENTRY hubs 4-8,
Line 2 wires ALL CYCLES to the PLUS hub for COUNTER 8B,
and Line 3 wires the TOTAL hub for 8B to the MINOR TOTAL PROGRAM hub.
<P>Line 4 wires COUNTER 8B EXIT hubs 1-8 to NUMERICAL PRINT columns 11-18
and enables zero suppression.
<P>Note, on original hardware, zero suppression was configured by changing levers
on the type bars in the printer (and not by wires on the control panel).
This property parameter defines
zero suppression for the field automatically, which is a compromise implementation.
</UL>

<P><B>Example 3:</B> Setting a counter for data-controlled plus/minus and
negative balances. Card column 54 contains an X punch ('-') for negative data.
Card columns 40-47 contain the numerical data.
<UL><PRE>
8a1 = 3.40*8
s1x = 2.54
s1c1 = cards
8ap = s1n1
8am = s1t1
8ay = 8ay
8an = 8an
</PRE>
<P>Line 1 directs the input data to the counter.
Lines 2-5 setup the X-punch selection of plus/minus from column 54.
Lines 6,7 configure the counter to handle negative balances,
by looping back the CARRY impulse and connecting NEGATIVE BALANCE TEST EXIT
to NEGATIVE BALANCE CONTROL.
<P>It is required that all ENTRY hubs of a counter be supplied with data
in order to properly perform minus operations. Unknown if original hardware
had the same restriction. Blanks are treated as zeros.
