<H3>Punch Card Accounting Machine Help</H3>

<P>This is currently a minimal implementation of the IBM 402/403
Accounting machines.

<P>The input hopper is located in the upper left.
Output stacker is located derectly below the hopper.
The program panel is implemented as a properties file.
currently, this file must be editted external from the simulation.
The START, STOP, and FINAL TOTAL buttons should function as on original equipment,
with the exception that FINAL TOTAL does not requires simultaneous pressing of START.
The run rate is set to 100 cards per second.

<P>The hopper/stacker are set to show 100 cards, with each card represented
by a line of pixels. More cards may be in the hopper/stackers, in fact
there is no practical limit (unlike original equipment). When a hopper/stacker
has exceeded its display limit, there will be a red line on top of the stack.

<P>Clicking on the input hopper will start a dialog to add a PCD file to the hopper.
By default, this will add the new file after all existing files in the hopper,
but the option "Remove All" may be used to clear the hopper first.

<P>Clicking on the stacker will empty it. This is for appearances sake only.

The properties files may contain the following:
<P><TABLE BORDER>
<TR><TH>Property pattern</TH><TH>Contents</TH></TR>
<TR><TD>[an][0-9]+</TD><TD>Alphameric or Numeric columns on printer</TD></TR>
<TR><TD>c[0-9]+</TD><TD>Comparing columns</TD></TR>
<TR><TD>[2468][abcd][1-8]</TD><TD>Counter column</TD></TR>
<TR><TD>list</TD><TD>The LIST impulse exit. values: "all"</TD></TR>
</TABLE>

<P>Print properties may contain one or expression indicating sources.
The pattern "[123].[0-9]+{*[0-9]+}" ("{}" enclose optional part) is used to
represent one or more successive colums from FIRST, SECOND, or THIRD READ.
Columns begin at "1".
The pattern "[2468][abcd][1-8]{*[0-9]+}" is used to represent one or
more successive digits from a COUNTER EXIT. Note, the most-significant counter digit
is "1". In addition, the parameter "aster=cycle" (where "cycle" is
major, inter, minor, special, final, or all) will print an asterisk in the
column on the specified cycle. Also, the parameter "zero" may be used to
enable zero suppression on the field.

<P>Counter properties contain a single source (as for sources of print properties),
plus optional parameters. The additional paramters are:

<P><TABLE BORDER>
<TR><TH>Parameter</TH><TH>Values/Meaning</TH></TR>
<TR><TD>total=</TD><TD>final, major, inter, minor, special</TD></TR>
<TR><TD>plus</TD><TD>add to counter</TD></TR>
<TR><TD>minus</TD><TD>subtract from counter</TD></TR>
</TABLE>

<P>While it may have been possible to operate a counter in both plus
and minus mode in different cycles, that is currently not supported.

<P>Comparing columns should have two source parameters, one for
a "third reading" field and one for a "second reading" field.
In addition, a "start=cycle" parameter may be used, which selects the
cycle which will be started ("impulsed") when the card field does not match
(i.e. a group change).
