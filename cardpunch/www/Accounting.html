<H3>Punch Card Accounting Machine Help</H3>

<P>This is currently a minimal implementation of the IBM 402/403
Accounting machines.

<P>The input hopper is located in the upper left.
Output stacker is located derectly below the hopper.
The program panel is implemented as a properties file.
currently, this file must be editted external from the simulation.
The START, STOP, and FINAL TOTAL buttons should function as on original equipment,
with the exception that FINAL TOTAL does not requires simultaneous pressing of START.
The run rate is set to 100 cards per second.

<P>The hopper/stacker are set to show 100 cards, with each card represented
by a line of pixels. More cards may be in the hopper/stackers, in fact
there is no practical limit (unlike original equipment). When a hopper/stacker
has exceeded its display limit, there will be a red line on top of the stack.

<P>Clicking on the input hopper will start a dialog to add a PCD file to the hopper.
By default, this will add the new file after all existing files in the hopper,
but the option "Remove All" may be used to clear the hopper first.

<P>Clicking on the stacker will empty it. This is for appearances sake only.

<P>Programming is done by a "properties" file, that contains lines of the
format "name = value". Referencing the original equipment programming panel,
the following are supported:

</TABLE>

<P>(*) Hubs are not labeled, implied that left-most is "1".
<P>(**) Comparator exits are chained automatically based on field defined in property.

<P>PRINT, COUNTER, and COMPARING hubs (as well as LIST) relate to property names,
others appear only in property values. COUNTER hubs can be used in both contexts.

<P>In the property value, a set of hubs (a field) may be designated by adding an
asterisk and the number of hubs in the field. It is generally expected that all
sets of hubs in a given property will be the same width, and that width determines
the property width.

<P>Also note that "list=all" is required in order to print on every card.

<P><B>Example 1:</B> comparing a field (current and previous card). Field starts at card
column 5 and is 4 columns wide. Compare triggers "minor" group.
<UL><PRE>
c1 = 2.5*4 3.5*4 start=minor
</PRE></UL>

<P><B>Example 2:</B> Add field from card column 5, 4 columns wide, to counter 8B and
print result into numeric columns 10-17 with zero suppression. Print/reset
on minor group change. Note how the 4-col field is positioned to
the lower part of the 8-digit counter.
<UL><PRE>
8b5 = 3.5*4 plus=all total=minor
n10 = 8b1*8 zero
</PRE></UL>
