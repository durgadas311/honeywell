Standard directives:

	.globl
	.if/.endif
	.text
	.data
	.bss
	.comm

New/revised 'as' directives:

	.space	<num>
		Move current section location counter forward <num> characters.

	.admode	<addr-mode>
		Set current address mode to 2, 3, or 4 characters.

	.byte	<char>...	[left, word]
		Place arbitrary characters into memory. Values include punctuation
		(all 8 bits are used).

The following may have the data item prefixed with a "Type II Punctuation Indicator",
separated with a colon.

	.word	<addr>...	[left, word]
		Create an address (relocatable) field from the expression.

	.string	"<ascii>"	[left, word; right, record?]
		Put the ASCII string into a field, converted to
		H200 characters. Invalid characters are converted
		to the solid lozenge. Lowercase are folded to upper.

	.float	<float>		[?]
		Create an H200 floating point data item. Item
		will be 8 characters long.

	.dec	<bcd>		[left, word]
		Create an arbitrary length BCD data item.
		Add a "#<len>" suffix to specify length if different from
		digit string implied length.

	.bin	<binary>	[left, word]
		Create an arbitrary length binary data item. Uses
		standard C notation for octal, hex, dec, and binary.
		Add a "#<len>" suffix to specify length if different from
		digit string implied length.

All accept a "A:" prefix which determines punctuation according to
"Type II Punctuation Indicators". The entire statement is considered
one data field (exceptions?). Default punctuation shown in [].
"<binary>" uses standard C notation ("0" octal, "0x" hex, ...) but
value is arbitrary precision.  "<ascii>" must only include characters that map
to the H200 character set - lowercase are silently forced to uppercase.

<bcd> and <binary> accept a trailing "#len" to specify the field length
('len' is always decimal). Otherwise, field length is inferred from digit string.

Instructions always have left-most word mark (on op-code).

Instruction formats:

	<opcode>
	<opcode> <aaddr>
	<opcode> <aaddr>,<baddr>
	<opcode> <aaddr>,<baddr>,<var>...
	<opcode> <aaddr>,<baddr>,<caddr>
	<opcode> <aaddr>,<var>...
	<opcode> <var>...

<addr> expressions:

	<expr>(x1)
		Index register X1 plus <expr>. Must use "0" not empty <expr>.
		(index registers are X1..X15, Y1..Y15)

	(<expr>)
		Indirect access via <expr>.

Labels in .text always default "left" assignment (first address
of statement). All other sections' labels default to "right".
This may be reversed by appending a second colon on the label
(e.g. "label::").
