.SH DESCRIPTION
.B Cread
reads one punchcard into buffer \fIbuf\fR.
The buffer must be terminated by a RM if it is shorter than
80 characters.

Returns -1 if an error is encountered, zero otherwise.
Note that the card reader
does not terminate the operation if the input hopper is empty,
it simply stalls.
There must be a special card to indicate the end of input.
This is typically a card with "1EOF " in the first 5 columns,
however the exact semantics are the responsibility of the caller.
